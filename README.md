Extension Name                     Status        Action Taken   Notes
Wappalyzer – Technology Profiler  ✅ Safe       Kept           Trusted developer, useful for analyzing website tech. Needs access to webpage data, which is normal for its function.
MSN + Bing for Chrome             ⚠️ Suspicious Removed        Installed unintentionally. Redirects to Bing/MSN, resets homepage/search. Mixed user reviews, possibly bundled with other software.


🛠️ Steps Taken
Opened Brave extension manager at brave://extensions/

Reviewed all installed extensions manually

Checked:

Developer/source

Permissions requested

Online user reviews

Behavior in browser (redirects, popups, settings changes)

Identified “MSN + Bing for Chrome” as unnecessary and potentially intrusive

Clicked “Remove” to uninstall it

Verified removal and restarted Brave

Confirmed that homepage and search engine were not hijacked after removal

 Post-Removal Observations
No more auto-redirects to MSN/Bing

Browser settings (homepage, search) remain unchanged

Performance: Slight improvement in startup time and fewer background processes

What I Learned
Some browser extensions are bundled silently or installed via popups

Even large-brand extensions (like Microsoft’s) can act intrusively

Reviewing permissions and removing unused tools helps keep the browser fast and private

Trusted tools like Wappalyzer are okay to keep if they serve a clear, safe function

Summary
Extensions Kept: Wappalyzer

Extensions Removed: MSN + Bing for Chrome

Outcome: Browser is cleaner, more private, and slightly faster
